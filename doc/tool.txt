How to Use Juneberry Tools


All of these tools are located in the tool subdirectory of the top level
juneberry directory.


setup_juneberry_server.sh

	This script automatically configures an apache tomcat server to run
	juneberry within the server.

	Usage:
		./setup_juneberry_server.sh [-c] <path to juneberry directory> <path to apache servlet directory> <path to data directory> <desired port>
	
	The compile flag (-c) is used to tell the script to recompile the
	juneberry source code. If this flag is not there, the script will use
	the current juneberry war file that already exists.

	The <path to juneberry directory> argument is used to give the path
	to the juneberry directory that is saved on the user's local machine.
	This directory should contain the war file in a "build" subdirectory,
	or have the necessary source code to compile this war file.

	The <path to apache servlet directory> argument is used to give the
	path to the apache tomcat servlet directory that is saved on the
	user's local machine. The script will add a juneberry directory to
	this server's webapps folder and add the juneberry source code there.

	The <path to data directory> argument is used to give the path to the
	local directory holding the data that the user would like to webify.

	The <desired port> argument is used to state which port the server
	should run on.


---------------------------------------


replace_treevotee_namespace.sh

        This script automatically replaces all occurrences of "the.treevotee"
        with "jpl.mipl.w10n.treevotee" in all files under the given directory and
        any subdirectory.

        Usage:
                ./replace_treevotee_namespace.sh <path to directory>

        This will need to be ran on the juneberry src folder in order to make
        files compatible with the converted treevotee source files, which is
        done with the incorporate_treevotee_src.sh tool.
        If in the top-level juneberry directory, this tool can be ran by doing:
                ./tool/replace_treevotee_namespace.sh ./src/

----

replace_junami_namespace.sh
	
	This script does the same as the above script, but for the junami
	namespace rather than the treevotee namespace. It replaces all
	occurrences of "one.junami" with "jpl.mipl.w10n.junami" in all files
	under the given directory and ny subdirectories.
	
	Usage:
                ./replace_junami_namespace.sh <path to directory>

        This will need to be ran on the juneberry src folder in order to make
        files compatible with the converted junami source files, which is
        done with the incorporate_junami_src.sh tool.
        If in the top-level juneberry directory, this tool can be ran by doing:
                ./tool/replace_junami_namespace.sh ./src/

--------

incorporate_treevotee_src.sh

        This script takes a treevotee jar file and a path to a juneberry
	directory as input and does the following:
                (1) Extracts the source code from the jar file into a
		temporary directory
                (2) Automatically converts the source code into the new
                namespace by replacing all occurrences of "the.treevotee" with
                "jpl.mipl.w10n.treevotee" and changing the source code directory
                structure from the.treevotee to jpl.mipl.treevotee
                (3) Adds the following comment to the beginning of each source
                file:
                        /*
                        This file is auto converted from open source package treevotee-x.x.x.jar
                        only for name space change from the.treevotee to jpl.name.treevotee
                        using tool incorporate_treevotee_src.sh
                        by user-name on current-date
                        */
                (4) Copies the new treevotee source code folder into the
		juneberry source code folder

        Usage:
                ./incorporate_treevotee_src.sh <path to treevotee jar> <path to juneberry directory>

	This will need to be ran on a treevotee jar file in order to convert it
	to the jpl mipl namespace and incorporate it into the juneberry source
	code.

----

incorporate_junami_src.sh

	This script does the same as the above script, but for the junami
	source code, replacing "one.junami" with "jpl.mipl.w10n.junami".

	 Usage:
                ./incorporate_junami_src.sh <path to junami jar> <path to juneberry directory>

        This will need to be ran on a junami jar file in order to convert it
        to the jpl mipl namespace and incorporate it into the juneberry source
        code.
