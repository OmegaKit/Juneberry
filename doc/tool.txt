How to Use Treevotee Namespace Tools


Both of these tools are located in the tool directory of the top level
juneberry directory.


replace_treevotee_namespace.sh

        This script automatically replaces all occurrences of "the.treevotee"
        with "jpl.mipl.treevotee" in all files under the given directory and
        any subdirectory.

        Usage:
                ./replace_treevotee_namespace.sh <path to directory>

        This will need to be ran on the juneberry src folder in order to make
        files compatible with the converted treevotee source files, which is
        done with the next tool.
        If in the top-level juneberry directory, this can be done with:
                ./tool/replace_treevotee_namespace.sh ./src/


incorporate_treevotee_src.sh

        This script takes a treevotee jar file and a path to a juneberry
	directory as input and does the following:
                (1) Extracts the source code from the jar file into a
		temporary directory
                (2) Automatically converts the source code into the new
                namespace by replacing all occurrences of "the.treevotee" with
                "jpl.mipl.treevotee" and changing the source code directory
                structure from the.treevotee to jpl.mipl.treevotee
                (3) Adds the following comment to the beginning of each source
                file:
                        /*
                        This file is auto converted from open source package treevotee-x.x.x.jar
                        only for name space change from the.treevotee to jpl.name.treevotee
                        using tool incorporate_treevotee_src.sh
                        by user-name on current-date
                        */
                (4) Copies the new treevotee source code folder into the
		juneberry source code folder

        Usage:
                ./incorporate_treevotee_src.sh <path to treevotee jar> <path to juneberry directory>

	This will need to be ran on a treevotee jar file in order to convert it
	to the jpl mipl namespace and incorporate it into the juneberry source
	code.
