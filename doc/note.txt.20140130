Juneberry is a software package that implements the Webification (w10n) API
for mission imagery data. It is typically run as a webapp in a servlet engine
such as Tomcat. Besides java, python (2.6 and above) is required.

0. Assumption

Juneberry package is designed with maximum deployment flexibility.
Our discussion here assumes NO admin privilege, so any non-root user
should be able to follow and install Juneberry under his/her own account.
For users with sudo or full admin privilege, some steps can be different.

As an example, assume there is a user called "doe" on host "mybox"
running Linux OS. The home directory is /home/doe.
Furthermore, user "doe" has a data dir called
/home/doe/data that contains three (3) collections of mission imagery files:
/home/doe/data/set0
/home/doe/data/set1
/home/doe/data/set2

Now, let us download all required packages/files:
$ mkdir -p /home/doe/host/mybox/pkg
$ cd /home/doe/host/mybox/pkg
$ wget http://w10n.jpl.nasa.gov/juneberry/download/apache-tomcat-7.0.41.tar.gz
$ wget http://w10n.jpl.nasa.gov/juneberry/download/juneberry-0.6.1p1.war
$ wget http://w10n.jpl.nasa.gov/juneberry/download/crossdomain.xml

1. Set Up Python Environment

Since juneberry-0.6.1p1, no python setup is necessary, if python is 2.6 and above.

2. Set Up Tomcat Servlet Engine

A java JRE or JDK must exist on host mybox.

Packages required:
(*) apache-tomcat-7.0.41.tar.gz
(*) juneberry-0.6.1p1.war

Decide on a port that Tomcat should be listening to, e.g., 8080, then
unpack apache-tomcat-7.0.41.tar.gz to its own location,

$ mkdir -p /home/doe/host/mybox/8080
$ cd /home/doe/host/mybox/8080
$ tar zxvf /home/doe/host/mybox/pkg/apache-tomcat-7.0.41.tar.gz

Next, deploy juneberry-0.6.1p1.war to ./apache-tomcat-7.0.41/webapps
as ./juneberry, such as

$ cd ./apache-tomcat-7.0.41/webapps
$ mkdir ./juneberry
$ cd ./juneberry
$ jar xvf /home/doe/host/mybox/pkg/juneberry-0.6.1p1.war

3. Configure Tomcat

Tomcat config files such as ./conf/server.xml and ./conf/tomcat-users.xml
must be modified. So is file web.xml inside webapps/juneberry.

$ cd /home/doe/host/mybox/8080

3.1 File ./apache-tomcat-7.0.41/conf/server.xml

(a) Inside the <Host>...</Host> element for localhost, add

<Context path="/juneberry" allowLinking="true" privileged="true"/>

This is to allow (i) symblic link (ii) CGI execution

(b) Inside the <Host>...</Host> element for localhost, enable (uncomment)

<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve" directory="logs"
               prefix="localhost_access_log." suffix=".txt" pattern="combined" resolveHosts="false"/>

This provides nice logging in the style of apache httpd.

3.2 File ./apache-tomcat-7.0.41/conf/tomcat-users.xml

Inside <tomcat-users>...</tomcat-users> element, add
  <role rolename="demo"/>
  <user username="demo" password="demo" roles="demo"/>

This is to set up a demo user for testing purpose only.
It uses Tomcat's MemoryRealm, a simple demonstration implementation
of the Tomcat 6 Realm interface.

Warning: in a production system, other types of realms must be used.

3.3 Dir ./apache-tomcat-7.0.41/webapps/ROOT

(a) Copy apache httpd icons to Tomcat's ROOT webapp

$ cd ./apache-tomcat-7.0.41/webapps/ROOT
$ cp -avi /var/www/icons .

This is to provide icons for juneberry web GUI.

(b) Download file crossdomain.xml and place it under ./ROOT

$ cd /home/doe/host/mybox/8080
$ cd ./apache-tomcat-7.0.41/webapps/ROOT
$ cp -avi /home/doe/host/mybox/pkg/crossdomain.xml .

This is to make Cooliris happy. It is a 3rd party image wall application
used by Juneberry.

3.4 File ./apache-tomcat-7.0.41/webapps/juneberry/WEB-INF/web.xml

(a) Configure data directory

$ cd /home/doe/host/mybox/8080

File web.xml needs to be modified to have Juneberry webify files
under a data directory.

Assuming data directory /home/doe/data contains three (3) subdirs:
/home/doe/data/set0
/home/doe/data/set0
/home/doe/data/set1

inside web.xml, look for element 

<servlet> <!-- w10n of imagery -->
...
</servlet>

change the following

  <init-param>
    <description>
    Root path of fs dir store.
    Default is /var/www/html.
    </description>
    <param-name>fs_dir_store_root</param-name>
    <param-value>/var/www/html</param-value>
  </init-param>
  <init-param>
    <description>
    Comma-separated names for entries under fs_dir_store_root
    that are to be soft-linked.
    Ignored if w10n_of_fs_dir_not_by_cgi_servlet is true.
    Default is "".
    </description>
    <param-name>entry_list</param-name>
    <param-value></param-value>
  </init-param>

to

  <init-param>
    <description>
    Root path of fs dir store.
    Default is /var/www/html.
    </description>
    <param-name>fs_dir_store_root</param-name>
    <param-value>/home/doe/data</param-value>
  </init-param>
  <init-param>
    <description>
    Comma-separated names for entries under fs_dir_store_root
    that are to be soft-linked.
    Ignored if w10n_of_fs_dir_not_by_cgi_servlet is true.
    Default is "".
    </description>
    <param-name>entry_list</param-name>
    <param-value>set0, set1, set2</param-value>
  </init-param>

This will instruct Juneberry to add soft links to set0, set1 and set2
under its context root, at its startup.

(b) Configure cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)

In the same web.xml above, add the following

<filter>
  <filter-name>CorsFilter</filter-name>
  <filter-class>org.apache.catalina.filters.CorsFilter</filter-class>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
  <filter-name>CorsFilter</filter-name>
  <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>

This enables CORS.

3.5 File ./apache-tomcat-7.0.41/webapps/juneberry/WEB-INF/cgi/config.py

This file defines what should be exposed.

If you want to expose everything, simply uncomment the last line to have
simpleFilter = None

Otherwise, follow notes inside to have both
list allowPatterns and denyPatterns set according to your need.

4. Test

Start Tomcat as
/home/doe/host/mybox/8080/apache-tomcat-7.0.41/bin/catalina.sh start

Point your browser to

http://mybox:8080/juneberry

and login as user demo with password demo.

To stop Tomcat, do
/home/doe/host/mybox/8080/apache-tomcat-7.0.41/bin/catalina.sh stop
